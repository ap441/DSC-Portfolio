# DSC-Portfolio

This is pretty much my first frontend project, so it isn't highly advanced or anything but I had my fair share of fun making this.

Made entirely using html and css along with fonts from google font and a type script from type js.

*There's also an easter egg, Good luck finding it(without looking at the code ofc)*
